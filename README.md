The U.S. Local Color Corpus (USLoCo) is dataset meant to assist in the research processes of scholars interested in U.S. local color or regionalist fictions. It is composed of 730 short stories, novellas, and serialized novel chapters that were published between 1865 and 1920. A total of 46 authors are represented in the corpus. Each text is categorized by the authorâ€™s race and gender and by various regional settings (by state, subregion, and ecoregion). All texts have been cleaned and saved as .txt files, making them ready for computational analysis.

This project was part of my MA thesis at Washington State University. It is open-source and available for anyone interested. My detailed written description of the corpus is available via ProQuest: (https://www.proquest.com/openview/1fd940d01b732fa1995aae20097c9022/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y)[https://www.proquest.com/openview/1fd940d01b732fa1995aae20097c9022/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y].
